# Curated Catalogs

Wildfire Commons users can create curated catalogs to collect and organize multiple resources (such as datasets, services, and models) that are relevant to a specific project, domain, or organization. These curated instances make it easier to discover and access related resources.

## Use Cases

**Profile Highlight**

Add curated catalogs to your user profile to showcase the resources you use in specific projects or find particularly valuable. As a subject matter expert, this is also a great way to recommend high-quality resources to the community.

**Organization Highlight**

Organizations can create curated catalogs to highlight the resources they have contributed to Wildfire Commons, helping users explore and engage with their offerings more easily.

**CollabStudio**

Curated catalogs can be embedded in a CollabStudio (whether for a Data Challenge or a Project) providing studio members with streamlined access to relevant resources.
