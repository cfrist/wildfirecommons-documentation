# Catalog 

One of the key features of Wildfire Commons is its extensive and diverse data, model, and service catalog, which offers a broad selection of datasets and streams covering various models and services. This catalog is enriched through collaboration with numerous organizations and researchers, who contribute listings which are accessible via the platformâ€™s registration service. 

To streamline data discovery, Wildfire Commons integrates a search engine that enables users to locate datasets quickly and efficiently. 

#### Substring Search 

Users can perform a simple substring search, which returns a list of datasets containing the specified substring in either the dataset name or metadata. This allows for broad searches across the dataset collection, making it easy to locate relevant data with basic keywords.

#### Filtered Search

To further aid in data discovery, users have the option to filter their search results by the contributing organization. This feature is particularly useful for those looking to access datasets from specific institutions, research groups, or initiatives. Filtering helps narrow down search results and ensures that users find data that aligns with their project needs or institutional collaborations.
